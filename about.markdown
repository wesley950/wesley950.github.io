### Introduction
Hello. Welcome to my diar... I mean, my personal blog! I hope you are here because you found something that I wrote interesting or helpful. If so, and you want to reach out, feel free to via [my email](mailto:wesleybarros950@gmail.com).

### Purpose
Like I said, this blog was created as a place where I put some random ideas I have from time to time. I was also always interested in writing (although English isn't my first language and I probably shoud've started in Portuguese) so here it is. Maybe this is an opportunity to finally start learning English properly.

In the future I intend to post tutorials of how _I_ do things. With that said, I'm open to suggestions on other ways of doing things.

### "Professional" and Academic Stuff (TLDR at the bottom)
My area of study, if you can say that, is actually [Environmental Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_science). I've always had a strong interest in programming and anything really related to computers and electronics. So much in fact, that I _almost_ chose to study Computer Sciences in university, but kind of changed my mind on last minute. I say kind of because it took me around one year to think things through to on the last weeks before applying make my mind.

In the beginning I was going through a rough patch so I thought many times about changing to Computer Sciences or even completely giving up (just like it happens with many other people). However, things _slowly_ improved and I stuck to my current course. I'm very glad I did so, because I'm absolutely loving it.

The reasons for why I was so undecisive are... complicated in my opinion (a little bit polemic too) and deserve their own post.

Finally, about my "professional" experience. I'm putting that in quotation marks because I'm still pretty new to this, one could say even I'm an _amateur_. Not sure if these words have exactly opposite meanings in English but before I get sidetracked again, let me explain. (Prepare for an overly convoluted story of how I ended up here)

I have been doing this since a few months after I finished high-school. At that time I lived in a very poor neighborhood (I hope saying that is not too offensive), so the prospects of finding at least a part time job were not high. I applied at a heap of places, from offices, to restaurants, to car washing places. Almost no responses. The few ones that did respond didn't pan out so I was left with no option.

One day I was browsing [Mercado Livre](https://www.mercadolivre.com.br/institucional) for a reason that I can't remember anymore, and I found an ad for some kind of consultancy company renting their billing software, it was something like what they use in supermarket. That made me think _"Hmm, maybe I could make some pocket money as a freelance programmer"_. And that's how I posted the first ad for my programming services.

At the time I only had knowledge of Python and a _tiny_ bit of JavaScript and HTML. I posted the ad nonetheless without knowing what would happen after. Someone contacted me the day after and asked to make a Chrome extension. I delivered it in about 48 hours and **it was the most excruciating task getting that shit to work**. But it was good, because about a week or a month later they sent my contact info to another person to, again, make a Chrome extension. It was a bit easier this time.

I only remember doing like two PHP jobs (again, completely winging) that same year, but they deserve their own posts.

The year after I started to only take on Python gigs since I was _way_ more comfortable with it. Made some sweet cash and was very happy and confident.

Around this time I also got to know the amazing [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) and later [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) frameworks. I started learning Flask first but lost the interest for a while. I kept only doing small Python scripting gigs. Then when I started learning Django I liked it more and felt very confident about taking more complex jobs. That didn't happen...

_**Phew! Are you still reading? Yes? Okay...**_

After sometime I met the _amazing_ folks (Peter, if you are reading this I love you) with whom I worked on the most fulfilling gigs and made some really decent amounts of money. These experiences made me learn lots of new things and I will always be grateful to these people. By the way, none of this was really related to Django or Flask, but still to web development to an extent.

I guess that's it for now. I will definitely post more detailed stories in the future about... well my stuff and hopefully it will be helpful or interesting to someone.

**TLDR:** If you are thinking about commissioning me because of something you saw on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/wesley950), I have a lot of experience with Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, serverless, web scrapping, databases and migrating between them, Natural Language processing, and a lot more. If you wanna talk, feel free to [email me](mailto:wesleybarros950@gmail.com), or you can also connect with me on Slack using the same email address.
