Hello! My name is Wesley, and I am a 22 year old freelance programmer from Brazil.

# Experience

My main specialty is backend programming using the Python programming language and FastAPI. I have also done frontend for a few projects but I don't count that since I don't really enjoy or am very good at it.

Check my [projects](/projects/) page to see some cool things I made.

# Education

To many people's confusion, I'm actually studying Environmental Sciences in university. I live as a programmer because I was interested in this since I was a kid.
