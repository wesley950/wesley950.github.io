These are some of the public things I worked on or am still working from time to time.

### URL "Shortener"

[Repository](https://github.com/wesley950/url-shortener)

I made this a while ago when I was interested in learning Django. A cool thing about this is that the short URLs are generated by concatenating random [Toki Pona](https://tokipona.org/) words.

### Devizzle

[Backend Repository](https://github.com/wesley950/devizzle)

[Frontend Repository](https://github.com/wesley950/devizzle-react)

It was supposed to be a web app where you write a letter, submit, and a random user would receive it when they open the app. From there they could respond and you would start a conversation. This was just a project so I could learn FastAPI, and I got bored after most of it was done and never got round to fixing UI bugs.

### Friends Network

[Repository](https://github.com/wesley950/friends-network)

A scuffed social network I made also when I was learning Django. It was supposed to work like a forum where you can post things, comment and vote on threads and comments.

## Closed Source Projects

I have also several projects I made for clients, including [LLM integration into chatbots](https://vertextlabs.com), Meta's products integration, article writers, one Pinterest app.

I'm mostly interested in working with projects involving LLM, I guess.
